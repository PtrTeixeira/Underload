## Underload ##

This is an interpreter for the [Underload programming languages] 
(https://esolangs.org/wiki/Underload), mostly just because I think that it is 
really neat.

### Usage ###
This program iw written in the Racket programming language, and will require 
that you have Racket installed to do anything. Assuming that you have racket 
in your PATH, then running 
```
$ racket interpreter.rkt <filename>
```
Will run the underload program. '-h' or '--help' provide more information. 

Other than that ... yeah. If you want to make suggestions or changes or 
improvements, go for it.
